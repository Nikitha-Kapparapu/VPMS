## Module Overview
The **Billing & Payments Module** is an essential part of the Vehicle Parking Management System, responsible for generating invoices for parking services and managing payment processing. It calculates parking fees based on vehicle type and duration, handles different payment methods, and manages the lifecycle of invoices from creation to payment or cancellation. This module integrates with the Reservation Service and Vehicle Log Module to accurately determine billing details.

## Key Features
- **Create Invoice:** Generates a new invoice for a parking session, either based on a completed vehicle log entry or an active reservation. It calculates the amount based on vehicle type and duration, setting the initial status as `UNPAID`.
- **Get Invoice by ID:** Allows users and staff to retrieve details of a specific invoice.
- **Get All Invoices:** Provides administrators and staff with a comprehensive list of all invoices generated in the system.
- **Get Invoices by User ID:** Enables users, staff, and administrators to view all invoices associated with a specific user.
- **Pay Invoice:** Processes payments for outstanding invoices, updating their status to `PAID` and recording the payment method. Includes checks to prevent paying cancelled or already paid invoices.
- **Cancel Invoice:** Allows cancellation of unpaid invoices, updating their status to `CANCELLED`. Prevents cancellation of already paid invoices.

### Invoice Table
| Column Name      | Data Type     | Constraints                        | Description                                     |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **invoiceId** | BIGINT        | Primary Key, Auto Increment        | Unique identifier for the invoice               |
| **userId** | BIGINT        | Not Null                           | Identifier of the user associated with the invoice |
| **reservationId**| BIGINT        | Nullable, Foreign Key (Reservation) | ID of the linked reservation (if applicable)    |
| **logId** | BIGINT        | Nullable, Foreign Key (Vehicle Log)| ID of the linked vehicle log (if applicable)    |
| **type** | VARCHAR(10)   | Not Null                           | Type of parking (e.g., "2W", "4W") for billing calculation |

## Layered Architecture of Billing and Payments Module

This module adheres to a **multi-layered architecture**, consisting of:

### 1. Controller Layer

**Purpose**:  
Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, routes the business logic to the service layer, and returns structured responses.

**Component**: `BillingController`

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/billing` – Create a new invoice (**ADMIN, STAFF, CUSTOMER**)
- `GET /api/billing/{id}` – Retrieve invoice by ID (**ADMIN, STAFF, CUSTOMER**)
- `GET /api/billing` – Retrieve all invoices (**ADMIN, STAFF**)
- `GET /api/billing/user/{userId}` – Get invoices by user ID (**ADMIN, STAFF, CUSTOMER**)
- `POST /api/billing/{id}/pay` – Pay an invoice (**ADMIN, STAFF, CUSTOMER**)
- `POST /api/billing/{id}/cancel` – Cancel an invoice (**ADMIN, STAFF, CUSTOMER**)

---

### 2. Service Layer

**Purpose**:  
Implements business logic for invoice generation, status transitions, amount calculation, and external service integration.

**Components**:  
- Interface: `BillingService`
- Implementation: `BillingServiceImpl`

**Key Methods**:
- `createInvoice(CreateInvoiceRequest request)`
- `getAllInvoices()`
- `getInvoiceById(Long invoiceId)`
- `getInvoicesByUserId(Long userId)`
- `payInvoice(Long invoiceId, PaymentRequestDTO payment)`
- `cancelInvoice(Long invoiceId)`

---

### 3. Repository/Data Access Layer

**Purpose**:  
Provides direct access to the database using Spring Data JPA.

**Component**: `InvoiceRepository`

**Key Methods**:
- `findByUserId(Long userId)`
- `findByReservationId(Long reservationId)`
- Standard CRUD: `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`
